What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, you create a home for all of your .git
data to stay. You need to do this because in some cases, there may not be a 
.git repository for your project and you'll be working from the ground up! It
also is necessary to staying organized within your project. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different in that it is a place where you can
see what files will be involved in the commit before actually making. There is
value in seeing that you might've called an incorrect file or one may be 
missing.
