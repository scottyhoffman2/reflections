When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repositories are useful because they keep all of that data accessible and in a safe place. If everything is local, losing a laptop can mean losing a lot of work. So, if you are committing your changes regularly, you’ll have nothing to worry about!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There could be some code that needs debugging in the in the remote repository, and so if you’re working on a fix locally, it would be a disaster if Git auto-versioned! Like the last prompt, if you are good about committing and saving your work at logical points, this system should work for you.
